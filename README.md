# weatherPrediction
Weather prediction system that employs SVM Regression to predict the amount of rainfall and forecasts the occurrence of Rapid Intensification(RI) event in the lifecycle of a cyclone using SVM Classification.
SVM Classification is done using different kernels such as Linear, Polynomial and Radial Basis function. Their performance is compared 
using a Receiver Operating curve.
SVM Regression uses a set of various features in order to predict the amount of rainfall.
